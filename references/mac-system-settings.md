## dock

```
defaults write com.apple.dock orientation left

killall dock
```


## menubar
I recently found out that it's possible to reduce the spacing of menu bar items to get more space. This doesn't change the size of the actual items, just the spacing between them.

`defaults -currentHost write -globalDomain NSStatusItemSpacing -int x`

The value I set for x was 6 but your mileage may vary. You have to log out and log back in for it to take effect. No restart required.

To reset it to the default setting, use

`defaults -currentHost delete -globalDomain NSStatusItemSpacing`
