## setting up brew

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## configuring brew environment variables

The following ensures brew casks are installed in the home Applications folder.  Useful if you don't have write permission under the `/Applications` folder

```zsh
# In ~/.zshrc or in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/homebrew/brew.env (default ~/.config)
export HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS="--appdir=~/Applications"
export HOMEBREW_BAT=1    # Uses bat instead of cat when using brew cat ...
export HOMEBREW_NO_INSECURE_REDIRECT=1 # Prevent download of suspicious origin.

```
